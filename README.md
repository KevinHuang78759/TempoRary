# Tempo-Rary

## Controls:

press `E`, `R`, `U` or `I` to swap which lane you are playing on
press `D`, `F`, `J`, or `K` to attempt to hit

At the end of a game, press `return` to reset.

## Description:

For now, notes are all singular click notes and are randomly spawned only on the active lane.

There is a competency bar for each lane; all of them need to be up in order to keep playing.

As soon as one competency bar reaches 0, the game is lost.

The competency bars of all 4 lanes will continuously decrease.

Missing a note on the current active lane will also decrease the competency bar.

Hitting a note will increase the competency on the current lane. Hitting a note more accurately grants more competency.

There is no penalty for hitting without a note.
