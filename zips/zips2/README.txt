Description:

For now, notes are all singular click notes and are randomly spawned only on the active lane.

There is a healthbar for each lane; all of them need to be up in order to keep playing.

As soon as one health bar reaches 0, the game is lost.

The healthbars of all 4 lanes will continuously decrease.

Missing a note on the current active lane will also decrease the health bar.

Hitting a note will increase the health on the current lane. Hitting a note more accurately grants more health.

There is no penalty for hitting without a note.
